		<div class="title w3-center">Our Mission</div>
		<p>We Are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A tuition-free public school</li>
			<li>Small, with about 200 students in grades TK - 6</li>
			<li>A place where every child and their family is known well</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our mission is to provide each and every one of our students with an elementary education that prepares them for middle school, high school, and beyond.</p>
		<p>We believe that a childâ€™s education is complete only when it includes a well-rounded curriculum that teaches them the necessary skills - such as reading on grade level and complex math - but that also includes science, music, arts, and language instruction.</p>
		<p>Our school day is from 7:55 a.m. - 2:55 p.m.</p>
		<p>We offer free breakfast and lunch to all children regardless of their income status too.</p>
		<p>Every child is welcome at REALMS. We pride ourselves in supporting each child to reach their fullest potential. We believe one size does not fit all in education, and REALMS is dedicated to providing students and families throughout the Ridgecrest area with a small school option that can meet their unique needs.</p>
