		<div class="subhead">How do I file a compliant under Title IX?</div>
		<p>A sexual harassment complaint may be filed verbally or in writing with the school site principal, Superintendent, or with the REALMS Title IX Coordinator (see above). You may file a complaint alleging sex or gender-based discrimination with the Title IX Coordinator at any time by telephone, in person, US mail, or by e-mail. Claims should be made within six months from the date the alleged incident occurred or you first obtained knowledge of the incident.</p>

		<div class="subhead">When must a complaint be filed?</div>
		<p>Discrimination complaints (alleging discriminatory harassment, intimidation, and/or bullying) may be filed only by persons who allege that they have personally suffered unlawful discrimination or who believe that an individual or any specific class of individuals has been subjected to unlawful discrimination. The complaint shall be initiated no later than six (6) months from the date that the alleged unlawful discrimination occurred, or six (6) months from the date that the complainant first obtained knowledge of the facts of the alleged unlawful discrimination. The time for filing may be extended for up to 90 days by the Superintendent or designee for good cause upon written request by the complainant setting forth the reasons for the extension. (5 CCR 4630)</p>

		<div class="subhead">How will a complaint be investigated?</div>
		<p>You have the right to a prompt and equitable response. REALMS will investigate your complaint and render findings within a specified time period. The investigation may include interviewing alleged victims, alleged offenders, and relevant witnesses, as well as reviewing available records, statements, or notes related to the complaint, including evidence or information received from the parties during the investigation. The investigator may visit reasonably accessible locations where discrimination is alleged to have occurred. As appropriate, REALMSâ€™s TItle IX coordinator periodically will inform the parties of the status of the investigation. The parties have the right to review relevant evidence. The parties will be notified when a decision is made.</p>
