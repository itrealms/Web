		<p>We Are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A tuition-free public school</li>
			<li>Small, with about 200 students in grades TK - 6</li>
			<li>A place where every child and their family is known well</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Our mission is to provide each and every one of our students with an elementary education that prepares them for middle school, high school, and beyond.</p>
		<p>We believe that a childâ€™s education is complete only when it includes a well-rounded curriculum that teaches them the necessary skills - such as reading on grade level and complex math - but that also includes science, music, arts, and language instruction.</p>
